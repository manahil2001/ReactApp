      <h1>About Little Lemon</h1>
      <p>
        Little Lemon is a cozy, family-owned Mediterranean restaurant located in the heart 
        of Chicago. Our chefs, Mario and Adrian, grew up along the Mediterranean coast and 
        bring their childhood flavors and family recipes to life in every dish we serve.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Since opening our doors in 1995, we’ve been committed to serving healthy, 
        fresh, and flavorful meals made from locally sourced ingredients. What started 
        as a small kitchen with a handful of recipes has grown into a neighborhood favorite 
        where friends and families gather to enjoy authentic Mediterranean cuisine.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At Little Lemon, our mission is simple: to bring people together through food. 
        We believe that meals should not only nourish the body but also inspire conversation 
        and connection. That’s why we put love and care into every dish, whether it’s a 
        quick lunch or a family dinner.
